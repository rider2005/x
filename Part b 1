Write a C/C++ program to implement the cat command using general file API’s.
#include<sys/types.h>
#include<sys/stat.h>These include the definitions of data types and structures used for system calls.
#include<stdio.h>
#include<fcntl.h> This is included to use the open() system call.
main( int argc,char *argv[3] )  Represents the number of arguments passed to the program.
{
int fd,i;
char buf[2];
fd=open(argv[1],O_RDONLY,0777);  

File descriptor   This opens the file specified by argv[1] in read-only mode (O_RDONLY).
  0777 represents the permission mode (though it's unnecessary here since it is only relevant during file creation).

if(fd==-argc) This is intended to check if the file was opened successfully.
{
printf("file open error");
}
else
{
while((i=read(fd,buf,1))>0)  Reads one byte from the file into the buffer buf
{
printf("%c",buf[0]);
}
close(fd);
}
}
